# Polaris Telescope

> Access Polaris from [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) to speed up your design or development workflow.

## Speed up your workflow

Sketch is our design tool of choice at Shopify. It supports the use of plugins to adapt to different kinds of workflows. While working with Polaris and Sketch, we found switching context between Sketch and polaris.shopify.com distracting and time consuming.

That’s why we created Polaris Telescope, a Sketch plugin that lets you search and view Polaris guidelines and code right from within Sketch.

Polaris Telescope can help you:

- Search for components and copy code directly from your design environment
- View our best practices and UX rationales while designing
- Save time by keeping your workflow within one window

## Type to search

When nothing is selected, type to search after you open the plugin.

## Select a layer for fast searching

When a layer is selected or when you change your selection, it will search again (based on the layer’s name) and instantly display the closest result found.

## Use it to grab code quickly

This allows you, as a developer, to quickly grab and insert the basic react components. To quickly test those components you can use a playground in [Polaris](https://github.com/shopify/polaris).
